# SAPUI5 Empty Template Project

This repository contains an empty SAPUI5 project template, designed to be a starting point for new SAPUI5 applications. It can be used to set up a new project or as a reference when troubleshooting existing SAPUI5 applications. The project includes the basic structure required for SAPUI5 but contains no specific data, configurations, or business logic.

## Purpose

- **Project Initialization**: Use this template to quickly initialize a new SAPUI5 project without any unnecessary pre-configurations.
- **Error Handling & Troubleshooting**: Use this template to test and troubleshoot SAPUI5 applications in case of errors or unexpected behavior.
- **Learning & Experimentation**: Developers new to SAPUI5 can use this project as a sandbox to experiment with the framework's features and concepts.

## Project Structure

```bash
project1/
├── webapp/
│   ├── manifest.json        # Contains basic project metadata
│   ├── view/                # Folder for UI5 views
│   ├── controller/          # Folder for UI5 controllers
│   ├── model/               # Folder for models (optional)
│   ├── i18n/                # Localization files
│   ├── css/                 # Custom stylesheets
│   ├── Component.js         # Main component file
├── package.json             # Node.js dependencies
├── .gitignore               # Files and directories to be ignored by git
```

This is a minimal, clean project structure that can be extended based on the application's requirements.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure that the following tools are installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [SAP Fiori tools](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/) (Optional, but useful for enhanced development features)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sapui5-empty-template.git
cd sapui5-empty-template/project1
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies (if applicable):

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Run the Project

To launch the project, use the following command (adjust to your setup if using local server or Fiori tools):

```bash
npm start
```

This will open a local server (e.g., `localhost:8080`) where you can view and interact with the template application.

### Optional: Using SAP Fiori Tools
   
If you're using SAP Fiori Tools, the project can be opened in VS Code or another development environment with the necessary extensions installed. Refer to the [SAP Fiori Tools Documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP_FIORI_tools/Latest/en-US) for detailed guidance.

## Usage

### Creating a New SAPUI5 Project from This Template

To create a new SAPUI5 project from this template:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Modify the `manifest.json` and `Component.js` files according to your application's specifications.
3. Add your UI5 views, controllers, and models in the respective folders.

### Troubleshooting

When encountering errors in your SAPUI5 projects, you can use this empty template as a clean baseline to isolate the issue. Simply copy over your configurations, views, or code to this template, and see if the issue persists.

### Common Errors

- **Missing Dependencies**: If the project fails to start, ensure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install`.
- **Manifest or Routing Issues**: If views or controllers do not load correctly, double-check the `manifest.json` and `Component.js` for proper configuration.
- **CORS Issues**: If connecting to external services, make sure your development server allows cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
